==============================
== Simmental TO DO
==============================

[ ] Move Character Description to a dialog box (remove from left)
[X] Add inventory to Character Description panel
[ ] Add Status effects (i.e, poisened)
[X] Zoom in/out
[X] Add Actions Panel -- i.e., (The Orc hit you with a battleaxe causing 22 points damange)
[ ] Rename Description to "Designer" and add menu item to display/hide it and dock left
[x] Move Character tab to a pop out (ctl+i)

Handle ground inventory
[x] Step on ground inventory, list them on the UI w/ description
[x] Allow pickup inventory item
[x] Allow drop inventory item

[X] Add Design Mode -- so description panel is hidden otherwise,
    and selection only works in design mode
    View -> Design Mode   (menu item that checks on/off)

[ ] Better graphics

[ ] Monster mechanics -- attacking / sentry mode / noticing
[x] Orc cannot walk through walls
[ ] Concept of larger objects (i.e. container objects)
[ ] Damage types with resistances and vulernabilities
[ ] Weapon proficiencies

Attacking
[x] Run into monster to attack
[x] Add Primary and Second Weapon to UI
[x] Mouse clicks to primary and secondary attacks
[ ] Special mouse click for menu of items to attack with, including primary/secondary
[ ] Show monster description on hover

Light Sources
[X] Have yellow circular light around main character
[X] Map not visited yet is grayed out
[X] Map within light is solid and clear
[X] Previously visited non-RPCs are dim when not in light
[X] Items and npcs out of sight are not rendered

Multiple Light sources
[X] Add .LightLevel (0-100) to Tiles, DefaultLightLevel (For night and day)
[X] Create ILight interface: w/ Brightness & distance
[X] Create items that implement ILight-- i.e., Torch & Lantern
[X] Add Laterns & torches to players & Orcs
[X] Before render, set all Tile.LightLevel to DefaultLightLevel, find all light sources, shine light sources in Tiles
[x] When rendering, make sure Tile.LightLevel is not considered if something opaque blocks the player from the tile

Designer+
[x] Add pencil tool
[x] Eyedropper tool
[ ] Redisgn tile color dropdown()
[x] Flood Bucket Feature
[ ] Easy Npc adding
[ ] Existing selection mode -- add cut/paste
[X] Undo Tool

Signature Support -- Idea: You can describe an item in D&D style text for the designer
[X] Implement SignatureFactory
[X] Handle containers 
[ ] Handle Entire format better than a comma delimited list (i.e., Descriptions)
[ ] Add Error handling when the format of the signature is incorrect: ie., Short Sword )mw(, Ugly sword
[ ] Have IItem implement ISignature


NPC Mechanics
[ ] Pheremones
[ ] Monster coordinations
[ ] Guard Function
[ ] Seek and Destroy Function

Technical Debt
[ ] Refactor TileAttribute and TileType into a single class and rename for better understanding
[ ] Stop doing commands CommandManager.Execute already does (pen, bucket)
